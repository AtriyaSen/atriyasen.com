I will soon be joining the [School of Life Sciences](https://sols.asu.edu) at [Arizona State University](https://www.asu.edu). Previously, I was assistant director of the [Rensselaer Artificial Intelligence & Reasoning Laboratory](https://rair.cogsci.rpi.edu) at [Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute](http://www.rpi.edu), where I received my Ph.D. in computer science in 2017, advised by [Prof. Selmer Bringsjord](http://www.rpi.edu/~brings).
